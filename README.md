# Distributed Linear Algebra (Distla) library

Distla is a library for distributed linear algebra. Distla expands on the basic functionality of DistlaCore to enable cloud-based linear algebra operations (e.g.m matmuls and various matrix decompositions) across multiple ASICs. This repository contains a Simulator for performing at-scale matrix multiplication, as well as tests and many of the cloud infrastructure components. Not all of the modules will work out-of-the-box due to removal of some proprietary code. We hope that this repository will be inspirational and useful for the wider community of distributed computing.
